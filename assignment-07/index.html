      <p>Truth Hurts
        [Intro]
        Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?
        Woo!</p>

        <p> [Verse 1]
        I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
        Even when I'm crying crazy
        Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
        Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
        You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
        Help you with your career just a little
        You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
        And that's the sound of me not calling you back</p>

        <p>[Chorus]
        Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
        Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
        Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
        Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
        Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (Bomb lighting)
        New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
        Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
        Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)</p>

        <p>[Verse 2]
        You tried to break my heart?
        Oh, that breaks my heart
        That you thought you ever had it
        No, you ain't from the start
        Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
        I mean, who would wanna hide this?
        I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
        I put the sing in single
        Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
        So you can tell your friend, "Shoot your shot" when you see 'em
        It's okay, he already in my DMs</p>

        <p>[Chorus]
        Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
        Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
        Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
        Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
        Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (Bomb lighting)
        New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
        Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
        Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)</p>

        <p>[Bridge]
        I'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)
        I don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)
        We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
        We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay
        I'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)
        I don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)
        We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)
        We just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay (Woo)</p>

        <p>[Chorus]
        Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
        Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
        Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
        Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
        Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (Bomb lighting)
        New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
        Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
        Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)</p>

        <p>[Outro]
        With the bomb lighting
        Minnesota Vikings
        Yee, eh, yeah, yeah, yeah
