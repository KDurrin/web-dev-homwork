For this assignment I really struggled with getting my mart-logo stuff to load correctly as you can see by the strange box that I have at the end of my page.  I checked what i did to what you did in the walk through video and it looks like I have everything correct. but when I go to my page it doesn't work.  other than that i really enjoyed this assignment.
