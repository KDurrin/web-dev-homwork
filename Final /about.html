    <h2>About the Artist!</h2>

    <img src="./images/ME!!.jpg" alt="self-portrait" />
      <p>Karah grew up in Missoula, Montana, leaveing
        a couple diffrent times she always seemed to
        make it back home.  Where she met her husband of 13 years,
        they have a 10 year old daughter, a german sheppard,
        and 3 cats.</p>
      <p>Karah is a senior at the University of Montana, she is
         getting her BA in Studio Art. She found her passion for
         art when she took a drawing class for the credit. By the
         end of that semester she had changed her major. Once she
         graduates she hopes to find her place in the local art
         community.</p>
      <p>She finds her art to be theraputic for herself and
         is able to escape reaility for a little bit while
         she paints. She hopes her art inspires others to follow
         their passions. </p>
