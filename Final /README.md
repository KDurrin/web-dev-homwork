# Final
## Karah Durrin

Everything in web-development was new to me. I think it is pretty neat. However, it really confuses my brain.

Web design as a whole is very new to me. I enjoyed the creative side of it.  but to be honest I'm not a big fan of coding.  I can appreciate it but it not something that i want to pursue.

For the final I chose to showcase some of my art work.
I have a passion for painting and very strong love for photography.
The paintings I chose are a few of my most resent.  While the photos are from last year.  I excited for the break to be able to take more photos.
