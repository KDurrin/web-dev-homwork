  <p>Shel Silverstein was an american writer</p>
  <p> who wrote many of the poems I grew up loveing</p>
  <p>He is best know for his childerens books, poems and</p>
  <p> cartoons.  As a child I would always check out his books</p>
  <p>and read them over and over.  Now that I have my own child</p>
  <p>I read them to her.</p>
