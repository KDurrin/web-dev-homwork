#Assignment-08
## Karah Durrin

HTML in a whole has been very challenging for me, interesting, but very challenging for me.  some of the assignments have been easier than others.  But I have to admit when I finally figure out a part that has been extra difficult I feel pretty darn proud of my self.  

I don't think I'm anxious to learn anything.  Im pretty excited to add more of the pretty stuff to websites.
