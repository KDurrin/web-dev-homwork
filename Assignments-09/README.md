The color pallet that I chose were my favorite colors way back then.  Jewel tones were a big deal back then so I tried to get them as close as I could
for the pink I used #a83137, yellow #d6ae46, purple #6c4963 and for the blue i used #48728c.
I used the color picker app and it made it pretty easy to find the colors I was looking for.  

I enjoyed this Assignment.  I do feel it was the most challenging that we have done so far.
